	<h1>When is this Thursday?</h1>
</header>

<main>
<p>It seems simple enough. When is this Thursday? 

<p>But, see, dates are dumb. Especially if they're vague. Vague dates are extra 
dumb.</p>

<p>People think they know when "this Thursday" is, but they don't all agree. Some 
think that "this Thursday" always means "the Thursday in this week." Others 
think "this Thursday" always means "the next Thursday in the future." And to 
those people, I must follow up with "Well, then when is next Thursday?!"</p>

<p>Because "next Thursday" can mean "the next Thursday in the future" or "the 
Thursday in next week." Or, I guess, if you are absolutely off your rocker, 
"next Thursday" might mean "the Thursday after this Thursday." What's more, 
"last Thursday" can mean "the last Thursday in the past" or "the Thursday of 
last week" or, I suppose, "the Thursday before this Thursday."</p>

<p>And people don't always pick the same side of these questions! They may think 
that "this Thursday" is always "the Thursday in this week", but also that 
"last Thursday" is "the last Thursday in the past."</p>

<p>And what if <strong>today</strong> is Thursday? Is today "this Thursday"? Depending on your 
feelings about the above questions, you may well think that the Thursday of 
last week is "last Thursday," today is nothing, and "next Thursday" is the same 
as "this Thursday" because it is both the next Thursday in the future and the 
Thursday in next week. </p>

<p>And if it's not Thursday, this puts every nearby Thursday in a sort of quantum 
state of both being and not being last, this, and/or next Thursday, only 
collapsing the waveform when somebody gets a confused look on their face and 
says, "wait, which Thursday?"</p>

<p>Here. Let me spend too much effort visualizing this for you:</p>
